## How to Use This Documentation

### For Starting a New Project

1. **Read**: `README.md` to understand the structure
2. **Follow**: `01-PROJECT-SETUP.md` to scaffold the project
3. **Reference**: `09-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` while developing

### For Claude Code Development Sessions

When you ask Claude Code to develop features:

1. Claude Code should **read the relevant guide(s)** before implementing
2. Claude Code should **follow the established patterns** from the guides
3. Claude Code should **reference `09-QUICK-REFERENCE.md`** for quick code templates
4. You **review the implementation** between steps

### Example Workflow

```
You: "Create a todo list feature with API, persistence, and tests"
    ↓
Claude Code reads:
  - 02-FRONTEND-GUIDE.md (for MVU patterns)
  - 03-BACKEND-GUIDE.md (for API implementation)
  - 04-SHARED-TYPES.md (for type design)
  - 05-PERSISTENCE.md (for SQLite patterns)
  - 06-TESTING.md (for test structure)
    ↓
Claude Code implements feature following patterns
    ↓
You review and provide feedback
    ↓
Claude Code adjusts based on feedback
```

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Create a New Project
Use `01-PROJECT-SETUP.md` to scaffold a new F# full-stack application with all the patterns in place.

### Option 2: Apply to Existing Project
Reference the guides when adding features to your existing applications. Start with `09-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` for quick patterns.

### Option 3: Share with Claude Code
When starting a development session, tell Claude Code:

## Feedback and Iteration

This documentation is designed to be:
- ✅ **Comprehensive** but not overwhelming
- ✅ **Practical** with real examples
- ✅ **Specific** to your tech stack
- ✅ **Usable** by AI developers

If you find patterns that should be added or changed, these guides can be updated incrementally.
